#### **About**

##### This repository aggregates, cleans, visualizes and maps data related to school transfers within Indiana's primary and secondary school system. The data is used create three Leaflet maps:

  - The **[Outgoing transfers](https://tedschurter.github.io/in-ed-transfers/outgoing-transfers.html)** map visualizes the number of students who transfer from a school corporation (selected with the filter on the upper left-hand side) to another public school corporation, public charter school or private school. Popup charts display the number of transfers from the selected school corporation to enrolled schools/corporations and visually contrasts their available test scores. 
  
  - The **[Incoming transfers](https://tedschurter.github.io/in-ed-transfers/incoming-transfers.html)** map visualizes the number of students that transfer to the enrolled school/corporation (selected with the filter on the upper left-hand side) from school corporations that sent transfer students. Popup charts display the number of transfers from a school corporation to the selected enrolled school/corporation and visually contrasts their available test scores.

  - The **[Net transfers](https://tedschurter.github.io/in-ed-transfers/net-transfers.html)** map visualizes the number of transfer students entering or leaving a school corporation per 100 students that have legal settlement within the corporation. A tooltip details the 2023 rate for each school corporation.

:---|:---|:---|
[20240131_new_transfer.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20240131_new_transfer.R)|Aggregates school transfer data from 2018 to 2023 into single data frame. Cleans enrolled school and school corporation names and replaces abbreviations with full names. Geocodes latitude and longitude for public school corporations and private schools using provided addresses. Manually adjusts incorrectly geocoded schools and corporations. Exports aggregated transfers to csv with and without latitude and longitude.|[transfers_18_23.csv](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/clean_data/transfers_18_23.csv)<br>[transfers_18_23_ll.csv](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/clean_data/transfers_18_23_ll.csv)
[20231214_corp_geo.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20231214_corp_geo.R)|Merges school corporation name and id with spatial geometry needed to map corporation boundaries. Because there is no common key between Indiana Department of Education school data and the spatial data available from Tigris, corporation names from both were used to join the data using the [fuzyjoin](cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fuzzyjoin/) package. Mismatches were resolved manually. Dataframe of school corporation names, associated IDs and the geometry data needed for corporation boundaries are exported as csv and geojson files. |[corp_geo.csv](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/clean_data/corp_geo.csv)<br>[corp_geo.geojson](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/clean_data/corp_geo.geojson)
[20231220_loops_full_data.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20231220_loops_full_data.R)|Loops through aggregated transfer data to create a chart for every transfer relationship established between a school corporation and another school corporation, charter school or private school since 2018 (nearly 15,000 in all). Each chart visualizes the number of annual transfers, contrasts the most recent available tests scores between the schools represented and details the percentage of a school corporation’s total transfers who are going to the enrolled school. The charts are used as popups in the *Outgoing transfers* map. Uploads charts to AWS S3. 
[20231214_incoming_xfr.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20231214_incoming_xfr.R)|Loops through aggregated transfer data to create a chart for every transfer relationship established between an enrolled school and any school corporation from which it received transfer students. Each chart visualizes the number of annual transfers, contrasts the most recent available tests scores between the schools represented and details the percentage of a school’s total transfers that came from a given school corporation. The charts are used as popups in the *Incoming transfers* map. Uploads charts to AWS S3.|
[20240104_stlmt_plot.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20240104_stlmt_plot.R)|Loops through transfer data to create one chart for each school corporation that visualizes the total and type of outgoing transfers since 2018. The charts are used as popups in the *Outgoing transfers* map. Uploads charts to AWS S3.
[20231208_top_xfr.R](https://github.com/tedschurter/in-ed-transfers/blob/main/scripts/20231208_top_xfr.R)|Joins transfer and residence count data then loops through dataframe to generate charts showing counts of enrolled students with legal settlement and students transferring in to each school corporation. Uploads charts to AWS S3. \*Charts not used in final map.
