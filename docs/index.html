          Indiana's Choice Scholarship program, where eligible families receive taxpayer-funded vouchers to pay tuition at private, often parochial, schools, grew 31% in the 2023-2024 school year, accounting for one of every three transfers out of Indiana public school corporations. Since expanding income eligibility to 300% of the amount to qualify for the federal free or reduced lunch program in 2021, participation is up 97%, well above the 18% increase in transfers to public schools during the same period.

          Introduced in 2011 by then-governor Mitch Daniels as an escape route for students in underperforming public schools, it was the largest school voucher program nationally, and statutorily capped at 7,500 students. Since then, successive state legislatures have eroded eligibility requirements to their current level: students must be between 5 and 21 years-old with legal settlement in Indiana and a family income of up to 400% of the amount to qualify for the federal free or reduced lunch program. As eligibility requirements have decreased, program participation has increased. </p>

          Understanding school transfers </p>

        <p class="body">
          School-age children in Indiana are entitled to a free public education in the school corporation where they live, their school corporation of legal settlement. Unless they've previously enrolled in public school, home-school students and those who exclusively attend a private school are not included in the legal settlement tally.</p>

          <p class="body">
          
          In 2024, that count totaled 1,070,827 students within 290 school corporations. </p>

          <p class="body">          
            Students receiving a Choice Scholarship voucher are counted as transfers. If they previously attended a public school, they are included in the count of students with legal settlement in the corporation where they live. If they had not previously attended a public school and then receive a voucher to attend a Choice Scholarship school, they are added to the count of students with legal settlement and counted as a transfer student.
          </p>
      
        <p class="body">
         Though the number of students with legal settlement in a school corporation is constrained by how many students live within its borders, a corporation's enrollment, the number of students attending classes, is more dynamic, fluctuating as students transfer in and out during biannual transfer windows. <p>

       
        <p class="body">
          Transfer students may move within their own corporation, going from one school to another, or to another school corporation, charter or Choice Scholarship school. Online learning has eliminated physical proximity as a barrier for school transfers and many schools and school corporations attract and educate students from well beyond their immediate reach.</p>

            <p>Students with legal settlement live within the boundaries of a school corporation and are entitled to a free public education there. </p>

            <p>Students that attend a private school, or a public school in a corporation where they don't have legal settlement are considered transfer students.</p>

            <p>Outgoing transfer students can be categorized based on the type of school they transfer to: public, charter or Choice Scholarship. </p>

            <p>Ninety-five of Western Boone's students chose to transfer to a different <span style='color:#d95f02'>school corporation</span>, a rate of 8 students per 100 with legal settlement. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p><span style='font-weight: 600;'>Outgoing transfers: </span></p>

            <p><span style='color:#1b9e77'>Charter schools</span> are tuition-free public schools that must accept any student who chooses to enroll. </p>
            
            <p>They administer required annual exams and recieve state ratings, but operate independently of many state guidelines regulating public schools. </p>

            <p>Fifteen Western Boone students transferred to <span style='color:#1b9e77; font-weight: 500;'>charter schools</span>, a rate of 2 students per 100 with legal settlement.</p>

            <p><span style='color:#7570b3'>Choice Scholarship schools</span> are private schools that aren't required to accept any student but can accept state-funded vouchers for tuition from qualifying families. </p>

            <p>As Indiana has lowered the barriers to receive school vouchers through the Choice Scholarship program, participation has increased.</p>

            <p>Fifteen Western Boone students transfered to <span style='color:#7570b3; font-weight: 500;'>Choice Scholarship schools</span>, a rate of 2 students per 100 with legal settlement. </p>

            <p><span style='color:black;font-weight: 510;'>Incoming transfers</span>  are students attending a charter, Choice Scholarship or public school corporation that is not their school of legal settlement. </p>

            <p>Their attendance may be physical or virtual.</p>

            <p>For every 100 students with legal settlement, Western Boone added 15 <span style='color:black;font-weight: 510;'>incoming transfer</span> students. </p>

            <p>Transfers arrived from 16 school corporations.</p>

            <p>The difference between incoming and outgoing transfers determines a corporation's net transfer and net transfer rate. </p>

            <p>One hundred twenty-five students transfered out of Western Boone; two hundred thirty transfered in. </p>
            
            <p>Its net transfer is 105 and its net transfer rate is seven. For every 100 students with legal settlement, it gains seven students through incoming transfers.</p>

            More transfer students depart than arrive at six of ten Indiana school corporations, resulting in a negative transfer rate. On average, they receive students from 14 corporations while dispersing them to 40 corporations or schools. These corporations tend to be larger, with an average legal settlement of 5,000 students, nearly three times the size of their counterparts with a positive transfer rate.</p>

            Corporations with a positive transfer rate send and receive students from an average 24 and 22 schools and corporations respectively. These corporations tend to be smaller with an average legal settlement of about 1,700 students.</p>

            The presence of alternatives to the public school corporation - charter or Choice Scholarship schools - within a corporation’s boundaries often influence its transfer rate. Corporations with more than one alternative are more likely to have a negative transfer rate and those with many alternatives are generally located near larger communities and have the highest negative transfer rates.

        Schools attracting transfer students from the most corporations aren't doing so solely on the strength of their educational excellence, athletics accomplishments or extra-curricular offerings. They are partnering with businesses that offer the expertise and infrastructure necessary to attract and educate students online and that benefit from the dollars that follow those students to the districts they serve.

        K12 Inc. is one of those businesses. Among its many clients nationwide are 10 Indiana schools and corporations, including three of the four school corporations that attract students from the most corporations.
